    ```
    for example : 
    ```
    git checkout -b branch-2
    ``` 
5. Add the necessary contribution and commit those contributions.
    To add the necessary contrbution that will get you accepeted refer **contributiion.md** file.

    Add those changes to the branch you just created using the below command.
     ```
    git add .
    ``` 
    Now commit those changes using the below command:
    
     ```
    git commiit -m "The changes that you done must be mentioned here"
    ```
<!--  
6. Merge the branch into the main branch -->

6. Push changes to github

    ```
    git push origin branch_name
    ```
    replace branch_name with the name of the branch you created earlier.

    Then if you want to mention anything about the changes type it in and finally  submit the pull request.

## Rules and Regulations

1. Pull requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab

2. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.

3. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.

4. If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

5. To get a shirt, you must make four approved pull requests (PRs) on opted-in projects between October 1-31 in any time zone.

6. This year, the first 50,000 participants can earn a T-shirt.

### examples of low quailty contributions

+ Pull requests that are automated e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace / fix typos / optimize images.

+ Pull requests that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request.

+ Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.

+ Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.

+ Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.
